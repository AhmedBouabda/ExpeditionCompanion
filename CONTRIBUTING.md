## Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

- Follow **Google Java Style Guide**
- Use **meaningful variable and method names**
- Add **Javadoc comments** for public methods
- Keep methods **small and focused**
- Use **Spring Boot conventions**

### Example:

```java
/**
 * Creates a new expedition with the provided details.
 *
 * @param expeditionRequest the expedition details
 * @return the created expedition with generated ID
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if expedition request is invalid
 */
@PostMapping("/expeditions")
public ResponseEntity<Expedition> createExpedition(@Valid @RequestBody ExpeditionRequest expeditionRequest) {
    Expedition expedition = expeditionService.createExpedition(expeditionRequest);
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(expedition);
}
```

### Commit Message Format

Use the following format for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(expedition): add expedition creation endpoint
fix(database): resolve connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing Guidelines

- **Write tests** for all new features
- **Maintain test coverage** above 80%
- Use **meaningful test names** that describe what is being tested
- Follow **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```java
@Test
void shouldCreateExpeditionWhenValidDataProvided() {
    // Arrange
    ExpeditionRequest request = new ExpeditionRequest("Mountain Expedition", "2024-06-01");
    
    // Act
    Expedition result = expeditionService.createExpedition(request);
    
    // Assert
    assertThat(result.getId()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(result.getName()).isEqualTo("Mountain Expedition");
    assertThat(result.getStartDate()).isEqualTo("2024-06-01");
}
```

## Documentation Standards

- Keep **README.md updated** with new features
- Add **API documentation** for new endpoints
- Include **code comments** for complex logic
- Update **configuration examples** when needed

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Manual testing** if applicable
4. **Documentation review** for user-facing changes

## Community

### Communication Channels
